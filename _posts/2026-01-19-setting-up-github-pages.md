Setting up a free hosted blog with Github Pages is surprisingly easy.
Follow the online documentation for setting up [GitHub Pages][github-pages].

As noted in the documentation, configuring blog posts with Jekyll is fairly straightforward.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

Posts are organized as `.md` files under `_posts`, and Jekyll handles the styling given very minimal input.
This allows for adding and updating posts quickly, requiring minimal attention from developers with regards to maintenance. 

While further customization is possible, I've opted for a very minimalist approach here so that most of my focus and attention can be on personal projects, while keeping readers informed on major updates.

There is no regular schedule for posts, and I will generally post when there are major updates to projects that I am working on.
