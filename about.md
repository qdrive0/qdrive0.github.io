I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience in the industry. 

I first grew interested in software development as far back in college when I designed an automated pipeline that combined the following procedures: 

1. Convert raw data from [lab-on-a-chip][lab-on-a-chip] fluid cytometry to image format
2. Run an image processing algorithm to detect cancer cells
3. Generate graphs for displaying distributions by cell type

The pipeline could be run at the click of a button, and saved the researchers I worked with many hours of having to process data manually. Surprisingly this pipeline was probably less than 100 lines of code and I spent more time discussing syntax with people who wrote the individual pieces of processing software than I did actual coding. What I learned was that a little bit of tenacity can go a long way in making people's workflows more efficient. And the empowerment and the impact that I was able to contribute with my work was meaningful and fulfilling to me.

Even more surprising was that I was completely unaware that what I had done involved software engineering, and even less had I considered it a possible career. 

Fast forward many years later, pursuing academia in biomedical engineering, succeeding and failing at numerous other pursuits, and self teaching myself programming, I ran into a friend who had shifted to a career in software engineering. After inquiring about it, and doing my own research, I found that, at least at the time, it was not too difficult to make a transition into a career in software.

Thereafter, I spent several years after in industry (insurance of all places!), honing my skills as a software developer where I realized that the road is long and arduous. But I was always excited to learn more and hone my craft, traits which should be a good fit for an industry that is always constantly expanding and changing.

My hope is to keep that love and passion for software alive for as long as I can, by continuing to build on my own time, and posting about my journey here. If you have read up to this point, thanks for swinging by and I hope that anything you read here may be of some value.
